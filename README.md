## Motivation

This is my first official project using C++ (outside of my class), so I want to start with something small like creating a simple calculator. Also, I want to practice using Git and GitHub in case I will get a job interview of related field one day. I hope that I will be able to contribute this every week!

## Description
A simple calculator with the following features:

-  Basic arithmetic (+, -, x, /)
-  Advanced functions (^, log, !)
-  Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.) (of course, without using built-in functions!)
-  Root finding functions (linear, quadratic)
-  and more...

## Usage

Look at calculator.h for information about type of functions that you can use. Then, you can change the main function to perform functions as needed. Once finished, compile using:

```bash
make
```

and then using:

```bash
./result
```
to output the result.
